# Motivation
### Background
* Coconut farming and its related industries play a crucial role in many tropical regions
* Ensuring the quality of coconuts at different maturity stages is essential for both farmers and downstream industries
* Currently, the assessment of coconut maturity relies heavily on manual labor making it a time-consuming and often subjective process.
    
### Pain point
* The traditional method of assessing coconut maturity is fraught with challenges and pain points:
  * Subjectivity,
  * Labor-intensive,
  * Time-consuming,
  * Resource drain.
* The pain point lies in the need for a more efficient, objective, and accurate method to assess coconut maturity.
    
### Objective
* Develop a computer vision-based system for coconut age classification
* Implement machine learning algorithms for image analysis and classification
* Enhance the accuracy and speed of coconut quality assessment 
* Facilitate decision-making in coconut processing industries
* Reduce human labor and error in coconut quality assessment.
