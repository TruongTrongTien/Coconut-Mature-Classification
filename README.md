# Motivation
1. Background
  - Coconut farming and its related industries play a crucial role in many tropical regions
  - Ensuring the quality of coconuts at different maturity stages is essential for both farmers and downstream industries
  - Currently, the assessment of coconut maturity relies heavily on manual labor making it a time-consuming and often subjective process.
    
2. Pain point
  - The traditional method of assessing coconut maturity is fraught with challenges and pain points:
           + Subjectivity,
           + Labor-intensive,
           + Time-consuming,
           + Resource drain.
  - The pain point lies in the need for a more efficient, objective, and accurate method to assess coconut maturity.
    
3. Objective
  - Develop a computer vision-based system for coconut age classification, 
  - Implement machine learning algorithms for image analysis and classification, 
  - Enhance the accuracy and speed of coconut quality assessment, 
  - Facilitate decision-making in coconut processing industries, 
  - Reduce human labor and error in coconut quality assessment.
